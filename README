Saturn is a simple datetime library for Scala. It is not intended as a full-on
replacement for either JODA or the JSR-310 javax.time libraries but merely as 
an improvement on using java.util.Date/Calendar.

You might be interested in using Saturn if you...

 - Never use anything other than a standard, western Calendar
 
 - Want a clean separation in your domain between datetime concepts
   like Instant, Date, TimeOfDay etc.
 
 - Find Joda over-complicated for your needs
